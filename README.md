## Wins
I feel like I had a well thought-out plan for this project which helped me stay organized with my thought process and workflow. I practiced the steps of MVC, familiarized myself with Mongo, Mongoose, and EJS. I was able to debug most errors I ran into by going back and forth through the modules and thinking more logically.

One specific win was getting the PUT method to work to update an activity. My routes and paths in the routes, controllers, and views were not speaking correctly to each other. However, with the help of the istructors and Suresh, we were able to specify the correct paths.

## Challenges
##### *BUGS*
One challenge I faced was bugs and trying to problem solve on how to fix it. One specific challenge is getting the PUT method to work and edit an activity. The user input when editing an activity was captured by the URL and did not display in the view. I seeked out help from several students and instructors, used other resources, and tried adjusting my code but the paths were not linking correctly. 

##### *Organization*
At first, I didn't know where to start but the HTTP Methods & MVC Chart, lecture ReadMe repos, and previous labs helped me get started. I consistently needed to refer back to my HTTP Methods & MVC Chart so I can follow the steps and complete one CRUD Method at a time

##### *Expectations*
Time and skill level is something I need to continually keep in mind. I have so many ideas for features and design but I must remember the time constraint and how long it would take me to learn/figure it out. 

### Shout Outs
I wouldn't be where I am at now without the great support system from General Assembly and my cohort. My team captain, Nellie, and the intructors were a huge help with trying to problem solve my PUT method bug. The Nellienators and several cohort members were so open to talk through hurdles and share their thought process on how to go about tasks. The technical help is greatly appreciated but the collaboration, comradery, and connection with team is what's pushing me through this journey.
